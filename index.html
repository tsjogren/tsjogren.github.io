        <h1>Welcome to Shark World</h1>
        <p>Sharks are a diverse group of fish that have been around for over 400 million years. They come in many different shapes and sizes and can be found in oceans all over the world.</p>
        <p>There are over 500 species of sharks, each with their own unique characteristics and adaptations. Some of the most well-known sharks include the Great White, Hammerhead, and Tiger shark. </p>
        <p>While sharks have a reputation for being dangerous predators, the majority of shark species are not a threat to humans. In fact, most shark attacks are the result of mistaken identity, and only a small number of shark species have been responsible for attacks on humans.</p>
        <p>At Shark World, we aim to educate and inform people about these fascinating creatures and their importance in the ocean ecosystem.</p>
        <h1>Hammerhead Sharks</h1>
        <img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/licensed-image?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ-O03t75C3UP0zIBDwLuQLBEUoBgeLLeOJ0BVWgEAWLNVPkFdybwfDp4eIMkn4k2NWC-Ir03HxrL2dwH4" alt="Hammerhead Shark">
        <p>Hammerhead sharks are a unique and distinctive group of sharks that are known for their unusual head shape. The hammer-shaped head, also known as a cephalofoil, is wider than the shark's body and is equipped with specialized sensory organs called lateral line systems that help the shark detect prey. </p>
        <p>There are nine different species of hammerhead sharks, and they can be found in warm, coastal waters all over the world. The most common species include the scalloped hammerhead, the great hammerhead, and the smooth hammerhead. </p>
        <p> Hammerhead sharks are apex predators and play a vital role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. They feed on a variety of prey including fish, squid, and crustaceans, and are also known to consume smaller sharks and rays.</p>
        <p> Hammerhead sharks are also known for their unique social behavior. Some species form schools during mating season, and others have been observed hunting in coordinated groups, a behavior that is rarely seen in other shark species.</p>
        <p> Unfortunately, hammerhead sharks are also heavily targeted by commercial and sport fishing, and their populations have declined dramatically in recent years. Many species are now considered endangered, and conservation efforts are underway to protect and preserve these unique and important animals.</p>
